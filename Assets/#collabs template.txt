In Need:
- (GUI Designer)
- Music & SFX
- Artist & Animator (2D)
- (Marketing)

Project Information:
It's a fast paced, level based 2D action game with some fantasy elements in it.
By the time i post this, the game itself should be already be working, but missing the visual and sound design.
- visual style can depend on the artists individual style, but i would like a pixel-art related style.
- Levels are based off a tilemap

Length:
Until the publication of the project on steam/discord store/anywhere.
Estimated workload: >2 months

Payment:
I am unable to offer you a rich compensation for your work since im on a very limited budget (basically my saved up money).
Whether you accept that or not, you will receive a part of the revenue the game is going to make.

Application:
I appreciate a good portfolio and will decide based on that.
 - Especially for animation work on characters and SFX
